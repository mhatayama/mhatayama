      <p>I'm Masato Hatayama, a Japanese in Tokyo. I'm a back-end programmer dealing with APIs, batches, and databases, etc. In my life, I try to live as frugal as a monk.</p>
      <h1>What I'm doing now</h1>
      <p>(Last updated: June 2nd, 2020)</p>
      <h2>Profession</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Working on a project of a certain financial services company for revamping their accounting structure since June.</li>
        <li>For a few months, I mostly work at home due to COVID-19. Fortunately, there've been no particular problems so far. I can concentrate on my work more at home.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Learning</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://kotlinlang.org/">Kotlin programming language</a> - My current project will use Kotlin heavily instead of Java. I'm practicing on <a href="https://exercism.io/tracks/kotlin">Kotlin track of Exercism</a>.</li>
        <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanji_Kentei">Japan Kanji Aptitude Test</a> - A Japanese language test specialized for kanjis. I'll take the Level Pre-1 exam in October.</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.jafp.or.jp/eng/">Certified Skilled Worker of Financial Planning</a> - I want to beef up my finance-related knowledge because I've got these kinds of jobs in the past few years. I'll take the Level 3 exam this year.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.shoubo-shiken.or.jp/english/activities.html">Hazardous Materials Engineer's Licenses</a> - It has nothing to do with my occupation or hobbies. I'm studying it on a whim.</li>
        <li>English - I've learned it for over ten years. My goal is to read any kind of non-fiction books written in English as smoothly as a native. I use <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> for memorizing new words I encounter in my daily reading.</li>
        <li>Mandarin (Chinese language) - Just in case China and their language dominate the world in the future. I'm watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttmqMaoMdVw">this video</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Misc</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>I've eaten mostly meat and egg (a.k.a carnivore diet) for a year. Somehow it works well for me. Nutrition is interesting. I'll try the opposite (e.g. vegan) someday.</li>
        <li>I've kept away from TVs and news for decades. It's helped keep my sanity. Now I'm trying to quit playing video games for the same reason.</li>
      </ul>
